|project_name| Documentation
======================================

|project_name| is a web application and API for agricultural land use scenario analysis, especially focusing on drought assessment and
hydroeconomic decisions. It includes user choices for changing economic conditions, yield, land, and water policies and
helps users understand impact of water reductions and recognize potential drought responses including changes in
regional cropping patterns, water use, gross revenues, employment and value added.

|project_name| currently models two areas: :ref:`the State of Washington <WashingtonModelDoc>` and the
:ref:`Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta <SacramentoSanJoaquinModelDoc>`. The model subdivides each :ref:`model area <ModelAreasDoc>`
into a set of regions with input data that are modeled independently.
