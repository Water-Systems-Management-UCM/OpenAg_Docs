The Nonirrigated Lands Regression Model
=========================================

The nonirrigated land model operates in two phases. Its first phase, a regression model estimates coefficients per-region crop yield response based on winter, spring, and summer temperatures and precipitation using region-level monthly input data for a recent period of record depending on the application at hand. The Washington application collects input data from 2009 - 2018 yet the most recent time window from 2015 - 2018 is employed.

Regression coefficients obtained in the first phase are employed to undertake modeling scenarios runs. Model outputs provide estimated levels of crop production and gross revenues resulting from changes in precipitation. This phase is run first without precipitation adjustments and then run again with it and the yield change is calculated as the difference between these to remove artifacts introduced by the regression itself.

OpenAg calculates gross revenues based on the new yield estimates in a similar manner to the PMP modelâ€™s revenue calculation: :code:`crop area (acres) * estimated yield (tons/acre) * adjusted price ($/ton)`

The regression model uses a more limited dataset than the PMP model, depending on how much agriculture is irrigated or nonirrigated. In order to reduce effects from small samples, it is limited to crops with large amounts of nonirrigated area, and it is only used in regions where nonirrigated agriculture accounts for more than 5% of total agriculture.

Considerations
-----------------
The regression model can occasionally show *higher* yields in response to *less* rainfall if the data for the calibration period had that response. In the Washington model area, this is rare, but has been noted as occurring.
