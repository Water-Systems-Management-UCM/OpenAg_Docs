Model Outputs
==============

.. todo::
    This article is a stub and needs expansion (including adding IMPLAN information?)

Direct outputs from the irrigated land crop choice PMP models are irrigated areas, water use and gross revenues by crop group and region. Direct output of the rainfall model is changes in the crop production and gross revenues by nonirrigated crop and region.

These model results can be viewed and downloaded as csv files in the web application.

Calculated Outputs
----------------------
:code:`Gross revenue = price ($/ton) * yield (ton/acre) * land (acre)`

Includes price and yield adjustments. The land quantity requires that enough water is available to support the grown crop.

    Comment
    This article should be clear to indicate that it is referring to the model outputs and *not*
    necessarily to the outputs available in the web interface (AR: this might be helped by not referring to the csv downloads in the text, 
    put in a link to “Viewing Model Run Results and Raw Model Input Data”).
