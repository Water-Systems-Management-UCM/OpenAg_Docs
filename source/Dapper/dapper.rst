How the Model Works
====================

We have preloaded the web application with 17 model runs representing the
base case with unmodified calibration data and then 16 runs with modifications that
reduce or increase.


As an aside for those wishing to use the API, these model runs were created with
a script that used the API. The script is located at

https://github.com/Water-Systems-Management-UCM/Waterspout/blob/release/docs/api_sample_bulk_create.py.
