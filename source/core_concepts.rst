Core Concepts in OpenAg
========================

The Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta (Delta) occurs at the confluence of the two
eponymous rivers and is a crucial cornerstone of water resource management in
California. While important in supporting agriculture throughout the state by conveying
water to key regions, the Delta itself hosts significant production of select crops, namely
alfalfa, corn, pasture, and tomatoes, among others. Challenges facing the Delta align
with anticipated climate change impacts rising sea level, saline intrusion, and increasing
hydrological variability. The OpenDAP model was developed as a tool to assess
economic impacts of changing economic, biophysical, water management and land
management conditions in the Delta. It is assumed that changes in these systemwide
conditions will likely affect production decisions including total area planted and
production factors use, intensity in production factors use, and choice of crops such that
returns to farm and management are maximized. The OpenDAP model was embedded
in a user friendly web application which runs an economic optimization model in
response to user-provided scenarios of land use and water management such that crop
profitability is maintained.


The OpenAg Model 
-----------------
The OpenDAP Beta Version model was developed using economic and
production input data for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and is calibrated based on
average conditions from these four baseline years. Unit of analysis consists of Delta
Islands and other agricultural clustered areas within the Legal Delta. The model is
calibrated using the economic principles of Positive Mathematical Programming for
disaggregate models (Howitt et al. 2012) and its architecture is based on the DAP
model employed to study salinity effects in the Delta Agriculture (Medellin-Azuara et al.
2014). The calibrated model predicts decisions of farmers on cropland use and use of
inputs including water within an island assuming profit maximizing behavior considering
expected prices, subsidies, yields, and costs, as well as restrictions on land, water and
crop specific restrictions. This is undertaken by solving the non-linear program
described by equations 1 to 5 below.
