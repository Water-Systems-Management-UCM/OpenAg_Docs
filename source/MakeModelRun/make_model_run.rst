Creating Model Runs
==================================
By default, running the OpenAg model with no modifications will produce the output that most
closely aligns with observed conditions, called the "Base Case". The OpenAg application
is designed to allow you to create your own model runs, or scenarios, where you specify
deviations or changes in conditions compared with the base case. You provide these in the form
of two separate types of modifications to the model inputs and constraints: region modifications
and crop modifications.


Getting Started


To run OpenDAP with adjustments to a set of input parameters and constraints,
a new model run in the application needs to be created. Model runs provide the ability
to define constraints on land and water availability within each region in the model and
to adjust the prices and yields of individual crops up or down as well. Finally, it is
possible to adjust the minimum and maximum area a crop can have in any region,
relative to the area for that crop in the calibration data.
