To run OpenDAP with adjustments to a set of input parameters and constraints,
a new model run in the application needs to be created. Model runs provide the ability
to define constraints on land and water availability within each region in the model and
to adjust the prices and yields of individual crops up or down as well. Finally, it is
possible to adjust the minimum and maximum area a crop can have in any region,
relative to the area for that crop in the calibration data.
