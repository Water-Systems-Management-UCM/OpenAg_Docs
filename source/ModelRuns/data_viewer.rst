When viewing model data, either as model input data or in the results section of a model run page, the
application includes many filters and options for how the data are displayed. In order to keep the most
relevant information readily available, the application shows only one row of filters and tools
at a time and you may show or hide additional filters using the menu at the left. When all filters
fit on one row, the menu on the left will not show and all filters are displayed automatically.
