Deleting a Model Run
----------------------------
To delete a model run while viewing it, click the :code:`Delete this model run` button with the trash can icon near the
top of the page. It will then change to say :code:`Click to confirm deletion` for five seconds. If you click it again,
the model run will be permanently and irreversibly deleted. If you do not click it again, it will change back to its
original state and will remain available for viewing. Model runs may also be deleted from the :ref:`model run listing` page.
