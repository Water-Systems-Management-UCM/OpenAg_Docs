Visual Changelog - May 2022
================================

Region Groups
-------------------------------

.. figure:: group_inputs.*

|project_name| now supports groupings of regions during model run creation to speed input of complex sets of
model parameters. Documentation will be forthcoming, but the feature is available now for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
model.

Groups work in-between the settings for All Regions and a single region by apply a setting to many regions at once that
overrides the All Regions setting, but can still be overridden further by a card for a specific region.

Net Revenue
-------------------------------
Net revenue data have been added as a model output :ref:`using a new formulation <NetRevenueLimitsDoc>`. Net revenue
results should be used carefully and must be enabled for the model area by an administrator and must be enabled further
by each user in their settings section.

New Basemaps Available in Data Viewer
--------------------------------------------
The default basemap |project_name| previously used was no longer available, so we found and added new basemaps you can
select when viewing model data (not yet during modl run creation).
