Changes to Visualizer Controls and Region Group Visualizaton
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: OpenAgNewFilterControls.*

Building on the release of region groupings, the application now supports
visualizing results with filters for region groups. Selecting a region
group in the filter is the equivalent to filtering to all the individual
regions within the group - those regions are also selected in the region
filter so that they can be de-selected or expanded upon for fine-tuning.

The addition of region groupings to the existing set of filters necessitated
a suite of changes to how filter controls are displayed. Now, tabs with
many available filters will show a menu of available filter options on the left
that can be toggled on or off. Filters will remain active even while not shown,
but the controls for the filters can be shown/hidden in order to keep the
interface more usable and to make it easier to find controls.
