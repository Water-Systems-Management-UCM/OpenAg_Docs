   :caption: OpenAg Changes for May 2021:

Display the Difference Between Model Runs as a Percent
-------------------------------------------------------------
.. only:: html
    .. figure:: chart_percent_change.gif

        Now, when normalizing to another model run, you can choose to display the differences as a percentage rather
        than as the raw values.

Settings Work Now + A New Setting To Increase Table Density
-------------------------------------------------------------
.. figure:: settings.png

    We've had a settings section for a while, but it had a bug where you couldn't actually change anything.
    That's been fixed and you can now make use of the previously existing setting to change whether the
    list of model runs shows all model runs in your organization by default, or just yours. Additionally,
    we added a new setting that allows for denser table displays by removing some of the padding in each
    table cell.

Better Communication of Disabled Region Adjustments
----------------------------------------------------
.. figure:: disabled_sliders.png

    Previously, when a model area supported an adjustment, such as rainfall or irrigation,
    but the region didn't support it, the slider would disappear from that region's card,
    creating confusion. Now the card disables the slider and displays text overlaying the
    slider explaining why the slider is disabled.

Removal of Regions with Disabled Sliders from Map
----------------------------------------------------
.. figure:: removed_polygon_map.png

    When we disable a slider (such as for rainfall in the above example), the region
    will also be removed from the map on the page when viewing the cumulative input
    modifications. It does not currently remove a region that doesn't support rainfall
    or irrigation until it has a card created for modifications. That is, if a region
    doesn't support rainfall, it'll still show on the map with the all crops changes
    until a card is added for the region.

New Chart Options: Set Title and Model Run Name
-------------------------------------------------
.. figure:: chart_options.png

    OpenAg includes a new section to define basic information for the chart, to allow for more useful
    exports of charts to use in reports. Options include a chart title and renaming the legend entry
    for the model run in the chart (default is "This model run"). The download button for the chart has
    been moved into this section to allow for setting chart options and exporting in one spot.
