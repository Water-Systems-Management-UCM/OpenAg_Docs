OpenAg includes a new section to define basic information for the chart, to allow for more useful
exports of charts to use in reports. Options include a chart title and renaming the legend entry
for the model run in the chart (default is "This model run"). The download button for the chart has
been moved into this section to allow for setting chart options and exporting in one spot.
