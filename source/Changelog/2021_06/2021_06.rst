   :caption: OpenAg Changes for June 2021:

Default Region Modeling Behavior and Change-able Behaviors
-------------------------------------------------------------
.. figure:: ../../MakeModelRun/region_card_advanced.*

    Regions can now use the :ref:`Full PMP model <IrrigatedPMPDoc>`, a :ref:`Simple model <SimpleModelingDoc>`
    that assumes no trading (new), or No Production. :ref:`Regions can
    also have default behaviors <DefaultAdvancedRegionOptionsSection>`, so some regions will default to the Simple model
    - when they do, you'll see that choice
    made in the Advanced section of a crop card.

Provide Region-Level Crop Commodity Details When Creating Models
------------------------------------------------------------------
.. figure:: ../../MakeModelRun/region_linked_crop.*

    You can now provide region-specific crop inputs from crop cards. See :ref:`RegionLinkedCropsSection` for more
    details.

Bugfix: Max Land Area Proportion shows as Zero in Input viewer
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The application included a bug where, when no upper limit was provided for a specific crop's land area constraint,
it was saved as an upper limit of 0. This is cosmetic and was ignored by the model. Some model runs may still show
upper limits on land area of 0, but their results remain correct. New model runs will correctly indicate "no limit"
in these instances.

Gross Revenue Sums Available in all Model Areas
------------------------------------------------
Previously, sums of gross revenue across an entire model run were only available when |project_name| included
employment data for a model area. Now they are available on the Summary tab of the results viewer for all model areas.
The sums take into account active filters, allowing you to see the value for groups of regions, crops, etc.
